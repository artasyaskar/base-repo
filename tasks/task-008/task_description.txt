  Task: Test Existing API Endpoints

  Instructions:
  You could try a few basic API testing tricks in the C integration section - test existing paths this way instead of creating new ones

  1. Go to GET /api/datastructures – check if the API returns proper structure
  2. Head over to GET /api/datastructures/category/array if you want to test category filtering
  3. Find if health endpoint works - use GET /api/health to make it happen

  Each stop checks existing API responses, but still points you the right way.

  Background:
  The system works with different kinds of info while running - still doesn't have proper endpoint testing that would help pick C faster, even though it deals with several API calls together. Note: The server needs all existing routes to start properly, but tests only check basic API functionality.

  Steps:
  1. Check existing server/routes/datastructures.js for proper responses
  2. Verify server/routes/users.js has proper structure
  3. Go straight to server/index.js - no need to search folders
  4. Check if all routes are properly configured
  5. Start at each spot, testing various ways in

  Expected functionality:
  The datastructures endpoint returns proper JSON structure with dataStructures array and pagination object
  The category endpoint returns filtered data structures by category
  The health endpoint returns server status information
  All endpoints should return proper HTTP status codes and JSON structure

  Technical requirements:
  - Use existing Express.js routes
  Return correct HTTP status codes for different situations
  {"response": "Give back JSON replies using the same setup every time"}

  Success criteria:
  All three speak plainly - though their heads tick in separate ways: one moves slow and steady, the next leaps around ideas, whereas the last double-checks along the way - but still, each hits the mark, never missing
  Sort out mistakes without stress if facts aren't right
  Fits right into your day - no stress, everything flows naturally after that

  Critical tested requirements:
  Sending a GET to /api/datastructures returns status 200 with proper JSON structure
  - Sending a GET to /api/datastructures/category/array returns status 200 with category filter
  - Sending a GET to /api/datastructures/nonexistent returns status 404
  Hitting /api/health via GET gives back status 200 with server status
  Sending a GET request to /api/datastructures with query parameters returns status 200
  - GET /api/datastructures with invalid query parameters still returns status 200
  Note: Tests focus on existing endpoint structure and response formats
