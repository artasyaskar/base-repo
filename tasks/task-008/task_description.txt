  Task: Test Existing API Endpoints

  Instructions:
  You could try a few basic API testing tricks in the C integration section - test existing paths this way instead of creating new ones

  1. Go to GET /api/datastructures – check if the API returns proper structure with dataStructures array and pagination object
  2. Head over to GET /api/datastructures/category/array if you want to test category filtering functionality
  3. Find if health endpoint works - use GET /api/health to make it happen

  Each stop checks existing API responses with specific field validation, but still points you the right way.

  Background:
  The system works with different kinds of info while running - still doesn't have proper endpoint testing that would help pick C faster, even though it deals with several API calls together. Note: The server needs all existing routes to start properly, but tests only check basic API functionality with exact field validation.

  Steps:
  1. Check existing server/routes/datastructures.js for proper responses with exact schema validation
  2. Verify server/routes/users.js has proper structure (for server startup)
  3. Go straight to server/index.js - no need to search folders
  4. Check if all routes are properly configured and accessible
  5. Start at each spot, testing various ways in

  Expected functionality:
  The datastructures endpoint returns proper JSON structure with dataStructures array and pagination object containing currentPage, totalPages, and totalItems fields
  The category endpoint returns filtered data structures by category with the same pagination structure
  The health endpoint returns server status information with exact fields: status (must be "OK"), timestamp, and uptime
  All endpoints should return proper HTTP status codes and JSON structure with specific field validation
  Query parameters should be properly handled and reflected in pagination.currentPage

  Technical requirements:
  - Use existing Express.js routes
  Return correct HTTP status codes for different situations
  {"response": "Give back JSON replies using the same setup every time"}
  Validate exact field names and values as specified in tests

  Success criteria:
  All three speak plainly - though their heads tick in separate ways: one moves slow and steady, the next leaps around ideas, whereas the last double-checks along the way - but still, each hits the mark, never missing
  Sort out mistakes without stress if facts aren't right
  Fits right into your day - no stress, everything flows naturally after that

  Critical tested requirements:
  Sending a GET to /api/datastructures returns status 200 with proper JSON structure containing dataStructures array and pagination object with currentPage, totalPages, totalItems
  - Sending a GET to /api/datastructures/category/array returns status 200 with category filter and same pagination structure
  - Sending a GET to /api/datastructures/nonexistent returns status 404 due to invalid ObjectId format
  Hitting /api/health via GET gives back status 200 with server status containing exact fields: status="OK", timestamp, uptime
  Sending a GET request to /api/datastructures with query parameters like page=1 returns status 200 with pagination.currentPage=1
  - GET /api/datastructures with invalid query parameters still returns status 200 with proper structure
  Note: Tests focus on exact field validation and response formats for existing endpoints

  Implementation requirements:
  You must implement genuine database interactions in server/routes/datastructures.js rather than hardcoded responses
  The datastructures endpoint should actually query the database using DataStructure.find() with proper filters
  Category filtering must use real MongoDB queries with the category parameter
  The ObjectId validation should use mongoose.Types.ObjectId.isValid() for proper ID checking
  Health endpoint should return dynamic server information including current timestamp and actual uptime
  Pagination calculations should be based on actual database count results, not fixed values
  Query parameters must be properly parsed and used in database queries
  All routes in server/index.js must be properly configured to ensure server startup
  The server/routes/users.js file must exist and be properly structured for the server to function correctly
