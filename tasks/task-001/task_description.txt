  Task: Implement Basic Array Operations API
  Instructions:
  You gotta set up simple array jobs in the C Data Structures & Algorithms section - hook in three fresh endpoints that manage array actions with alternative tools rather than the usual ones

  1. GET /api/array/total – Pull total value from number list using basic fetch
  2. POST /api/array/reverse – Flip the sequence of items inside a list
  3. Grab the highest item from the list using GET /api/list/high

  Every endpoint takes a JSON input that includes an "array" of numbers, but gives back the right outcome. While using this data, each setup processes the list separately instead of combining actions. The structure stays consistent no matter how many requests are made, so responses remain steady and easy to follow. No extra details come through when transmitting - just clean outputs based on what’s provided.

  Background:
  The system manages data kinds with clever reasoning - yet misses simple stages that guide newbies through C code.

  Critical tested requirements:
  - Send a POST to /api/array/sum → get {"sum": } if data's correct
  - Hit /api/array/sum with a POST; receive {"sum": 0} when the array's empty
  - POST /api/array/reverse gives back {"reversed": } when data's correct
  - Send a POST to /api/array/max; if data's correct, you get back {"max": }
    The POST route on /api/array/max needs to manage negative values just fine – no surprises expected
  - POST /api/array/sum checks info first; if array's gone, sends back 400

  Steps:
  1. Create a fresh route file - call it server/routes/array.js
  2. Start three spots for managing tasks - one spot where you drop new ones, another that removes them, while the third adjusts existing entries
  3. Hook up the path in the main server script (server/index.js), but use a different name this go-around
  4. Check the details carefully - spot mistakes quietly
  5. Check every endpoint using different inputs

  Expected functionality:
  The whole method scans each number quickly, moving in circles instead of going one at a time
  The array flips, switching order - once done, the shift takes effect.
  The array max endpoint grabs the top number from a list by checking one item after another - comparing each to find which is bigger up to now. Step by step, it pushes ahead, never leaping, just holding onto values that beat the prior high. As it scans from left to right, it keeps focus on upward shifts only. When finished, it gives back that peak figure straight away
  - When the array’s empty, sum gives zero; else, reverse just sends back a blank list
  Check it out - make sure the correct items were included

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js for routing
    Built strong, handles errors quick - right from the beginning by picking the correct HTTP status codes
    Check it out first - make sure the list exists before you start working on anything
    {"response": "Give back JSON answers that always look alike"}
  - Deal with odd situations – such as blank lists

  Success criteria:
  All three places work fine when handled right - quick response from one, even solo; stays solid through testing
  - Handle errors calmly when details are wrong
  - Consistent JSON response format
  Fits smoothly alongside what’s already going on
