  Task: Implement Basic Array Operations API

  Instructions:
  You could try a few basic array tasks in the C data structures section - build three new paths this way instead of that one

  1. Go to POST /api/array/sum – count all numbers in the lineup, work with whatever’s there
  2. Head over to POST /api/array/reverse if you want to reverse the list - shifting elements from back to front. Use this route whenever you're looking for fast reshuffling, no fuss, just works
  3. Find the largest number in a list - use POST /api/array/max to make it happen

  Each stop sends over a bunch of numbers in JSON, but still points you the right way. Pick whatever path - either gets you there just fine.

  Background:
  The system works with different kinds of info while running - still doesn't have simple list features that would help pick C faster, even though it deals with several inputs together.

  Steps:
  1. Create a new route file - name it server/routes/array.js
  2. Set up three roles tackling list tasks with new twists instead of usual shortcuts - stay clean, avoid tough words. Try weird phrasing per line depending on aim. Replace 'and' or 'plus' with joins like 'yet', 'meanwhile', 'though'. Drop filler, stop repeats. Keep it brief. Hit close to original line number
  3. Go straight to server/index.js - no need to search folders
  4. Look at the words, notice issues but stay calm
  5. Start at each spot, testing various ways in

  Expected functionality:
  The entire gadget pulls each digit, then sends out an answer
  The reverse endpoint returns outcomes in backward sequence instead of the usual way
  The max endpoint picks the biggest number by scanning each entry one after another; once a value clears the test, it keeps going - dropping lower ones along the way until just the highest remains
  - If lists have nothing inside, sum gives back 0
  Check if the array field exists for the sum endpoint

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js for routing
  Show clear error details – use the correct HTTP status code
  See if the list exists - hurry past when it's gone
  {"response": "Give back JSON replies using the same setup every time"}

  Success criteria:
  All three speak plainly - though their heads tick in separate ways: one moves slow and steady, the next leaps around ideas, whereas the last double-checks along the way - but still, each hits the mark, never missing
  Sort out mistakes without stress if facts aren't right
  - Consistent JSON formatting
  Fits right into your day - no stress, everything flows naturally after that

  Critical tested requirements:
  Sending a POST to /api/array/sum returns {"sum": <value>} if the input's correct
  - Sending a POST to /api/array/sum returns {"sum": 0} if the arrays are blank
  - Sending a POST to /api/array/sum breaks with 400 if no array is there
  Hitting /api/array/reverse via POST, while sending valid data, gives back a response such as {"reversed": <array>}
  Sending a POST request to /api/array/max returns {"max": <value>} once it runs correctly
  - POST /api/array/max handles negative values without issues
  Note: Error handling tests only cover missing array field for sum endpoint
