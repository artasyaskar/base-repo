  Task: Implement Basic Array Operations API
  Instructions:
  You need to include basic array operations on the C Data Structures & Algorithms page - so create three new paths handling array functions using different links like "but", "also", or "then" instead of plain connectors

  1. Hit POST /api/array/sum to total the numbers inside an integer list through this route
  2. POST /api/array/reverse – Reverse the elements inside an array
  3. GET /api/list/top – Pull the top thing from a list using this call

  Each endpoint should accept a JSON payload with an "array" field containing an array of integers and return the appropriate result.

  Background:
  The system deals with data kinds along with logic paths but lacks basic array actions essential for starting C. Although it includes concepts, real-world use isn’t supported well. A few parts run smoothly although major elements seem half-done. Grasping fundamentals becomes tougher without such components. Easy jobs need more effort because help is absent.

  Steps:
  1. Create a new route file – name it server/routes/array.js
  2. Create a route to manage adding items to the list - build another one for removing entries - design a third to update values inside
  3. Put the route right in the main server file - located at server/index.js
  4. Look at inputs closely - fix errors calmly with backups or warnings, so everything keeps working without failing
  5. Try each point with varied entries

  Expected functionality:
  - The array sum thing piles numbers from the list one after another, building the total slowly along the way
  - Flipping the list around is what the array reverse function does, returning it in reverse order.
    The array max endpoint returns the highest number from your given list - though it only works with numeric entries. It checks each value inside, then spits out the largest one found so far
  - If the list has nothing inside, adding everything makes zero; on the other hand, flipping it returns a blank list
    Look at what’s entered – confirm required bits are there

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js for routing
  - Use clear error replies with proper HTTP codes
    Make sure the array field is there by verifying what’s entered
    {"response": "Give back JSON answers that always look alike"}
  - Handle odd issues - say, empty lists

  Success criteria:
  All three endpoints run smooth once they receive correct inputs - each answers properly when fed valid info or triggered as intended
  - Deal with errors calmly if people enter random stuff
  - Consistent JSON response format
    Plays well with your existing server setup

  Critical tested requirements:
  - POST /api/array/sum with a POST; expect {"sum": <calculated_sum>} when info is right
  - POST /api/array/sum should handle empty arrays by giving back {"sum": 0}
  - POST /api/array/reverse should return {"reversed": } if the data's right
  - Send a POST to /api/array/max, you get {"max": } if things are right
  - The POST endpoint at /api/array/max should handle negative numbers without issues
  - POST /api/array/sum looks at the data, gives back 400 when array isn't there
