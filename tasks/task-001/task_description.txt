  Task: Implement Basic Array Operations API

  Instructions:
  You'll probably need a few basic array tasks in the C data structures and algorithms section - just set up three new endpoints like this

  1. POST /api/array/sum – Add up each value found in a list
  2. POST /api/array/reverse – Use this route to reverse item order in a list
  3. Find highest number in a list using GET /api/array/max

  Each endpoint receives a JSON bundle filled with digits, but still returns the correct result. Pick any - your outcome stays the same.

  Background:
  The system works with different types of data while running, but it doesn't include simple array features that help when picking up C.

  Steps:
  1. Create a new route file - name it server/routes/array.js
  2. Create three endpoints which manage tasks involving arrays
  3. Go to server/index.js instead of diving into subfolders
  4. Look at what's written, find issues quietly
  5. Test each endpoint with various inputs

  Expected functionality:
  The sum endpoint takes all numbers, after that returns the outcome
  The reverse endpoint returns the elements in backward order instead of the usual way
  The max endpoint picks the biggest number from the list by going through each item - one after another - using checks that run step by step until the largest pops out
  - If lists have nothing inside, sum gives back 0, but reverse returns [] while max still shows 400
  See whether the array field exists

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js for routing
  Show clear error messages – pick the right HTTP status code
  See if the list exists – move on if it isn't around
  {"response": "Give back JSON replies using the same setup every time"}
  - Handle empty or strange lists without issues

  Success criteria:
  All three places nail it when given solid info - yet each ticks differently inside; one moves piece by piece, another hops randomly through tasks, whereas the last verifies while moving forward - but every time, they land on target, no misses
  - Deal with mistakes coolly if info’s off
  - Consistent JSON formatting
  Fits neatly into what you already use - no stress, no fuss

  Critical tested requirements:
  - Hitting /api/array/sum with a POST returns {"sum": } if the input’s right
  - Sending a POST request to /api/array/sum returns {"sum": 0} if the arrays are blank
  - Sending a POST request to /api/array/sum returns error 400 if no array is included
  - Sending proper data to POST /api/array/reverse returns {"reversed": } as response
  - Hitting /api/array/reverse with a POST and no body returns {"reversed": []}
  - Hitting POST /api/array/reverse without an array triggers a 400 error
  Sending a POST request to /api/array/max returns {"max": } if the info’s right
  - POST /api/array/max handles negative numbers without issues
  - Send a POST to /api/array/max → gets 400 when list’s missing or empty
