  Task: Implement Number Calculation API

  Instructions:
  You could try a few basic number tricks in the C math section - build three new paths this way instead of that one

  1. Go to POST /api/number/double – multiply each digit by two
  2. Head over to POST /api/number/square if you want to boost the numbers - raising each value to its own power
  3. Find if a number is even or odd - use POST /api/number/even to make it happen

  Each stop sends over a bunch of numbers in JSON, but still points you the right way.

  Background:
  The system works with different kinds of info while running - still doesn't have simple math features that would help pick C faster, even though it deals with several digits together. Note: The server needs string routes to start properly, but tests only check number operations.

  Steps:
  1. Create a new route file - name it server/routes/number.js
  2. Create another route file - name it server/routes/string.js (needed for server to start, but not tested)
  3. Go straight to server/index.js - no need to search folders
  4. Add the number and string routes to the server
  5. Start at each spot, testing various ways in

  Expected functionality:
  The double endpoint returns outcomes multiplied by two instead of the usual way
  The square endpoint picks each value and raises it to its own power
  The even endpoint checks if numbers divide cleanly by two
  - If lists have nothing inside, double returns []
  Check if the number field exists for the double endpoint only

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js for routing
  Return correct HTTP status codes for tested situations
  {"response": "Give back JSON replies using the same setup every time"}

  Success criteria:
  All three speak plainly - though their heads tick in separate ways: one moves slow and steady, the next leaps around ideas, whereas the last double-checks along the way - but still, each hits the mark, never missing
  Sort out mistakes without stress if facts aren't right
  Fits right into your day - no stress, everything flows naturally after that

  Critical tested requirements:
  Sending a POST to /api/number/double returns {"doubled": [2, 4, 6]} when given [1, 2, 3]
  - Sending a POST to /api/number/double returns {"doubled": []} if the numbers are blank
  - Sending a POST to /api/number/double breaks with 400 if no number is there
  Hitting /api/number/square via POST with [2] gives back {"squared": [4]}
  Sending a POST request to /api/number/even with 4 returns {"even": true}
  - POST /api/number/even with 3 returns {"even": false}
  Note: Error handling only tested for double endpoint missing field
