  Task: Implement String Manipulation API

  Instructions:
  You could try a few basic string tasks in the C text processing section - build three new paths this way instead of that one

  1. Go to POST /api/string/length – count all letters in the message, work with whatever's there
  2. Head over to POST /api/string/uppercase if you want to shout the words - turning each letter big and bold. Use this route whenever you're looking for loud text, no fuss, just works
  3. Find the first letter in a message - use POST /api/string/first to make it happen

  Each stop sends over a bunch of text in JSON, but still points you the right way. Pick whatever path - either gets you there just fine.

  Background:
  The system works with different kinds of info while running - still doesn't have simple text features that would help pick C faster, even though it deals with several words together.

  Steps:
  1. Create a new route file - name it server/routes/string.js
  2. Set up three roles tackling text tasks with new twists instead of usual shortcuts - stay clean, avoid tough words. Try weird phrasing per line depending on aim. Replace 'and' or 'plus' with joins like 'yet', 'meanwhile', 'though'. Drop filler, stop repeats. Keep it brief. Hit close to original line number
  3. Go straight to server/index.js - no need to search folders
  4. Look at the words, notice issues but stay calm
  5. Start at each spot, testing various ways in

  Expected functionality:
  The entire gadget pulls each letter, then sends out an answer
  The uppercase endpoint returns outcomes in big letters instead of the usual way
  The first endpoint picks the starting letter by scanning each word one after another; once a letter clears the test, it keeps going - dropping others along the way until just the beginning remains
  - If messages have nothing inside, length gives back 0, but first returns null
  Check if the text field exists for the length endpoint

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js for routing
  Show clear error details – use the correct HTTP status code
  See if the message exists - hurry past when it's gone
  {"response": "Give back JSON replies using the same setup every time"}

  Success criteria:
  All three speak plainly - though their heads tick in separate ways: one moves slow and steady, the next leaps around ideas, whereas the last double-checks along the way - but still, each hits the mark, never missing
  Sort out mistakes without stress if facts aren't right
  - Consistent JSON formatting
  Fits right into your day - no stress, everything flows naturally after that

  Critical tested requirements:
  Sending a POST to /api/string/length returns {"length": 5} when given "hello"
  - Sending a POST to /api/string/length returns {"length": 0} if the message is blank
  - Sending a POST to /api/string/length breaks with 400 if no text is there
  Hitting /api/string/uppercase via POST with "cat" gives back {"uppercase": "CAT"}
  Sending a POST request to /api/string/first with "dog" returns {"first": "d"}
  - POST /api/string/first with "" returns {"first": null}
  Note: Error handling tests only cover missing text field for length endpoint
