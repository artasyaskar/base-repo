  Task: Implement Simple Echo API

  Instructions:
  You could try a few basic echo tricks in the C messaging section - build three new paths this way instead of that one

  1. Go to POST /api/echo/text – return the same text back
  2. Head over to POST /api/echo/number if you want to return the same number
  3. Find if two values match - use POST /api/echo/match to make it happen

  Each stop sends over data in JSON, but still points you the right way.

  Background:
  The system works with different kinds of info while running - still doesn't have simple echo features that would help pick C faster, even though it deals with several digits together. Note: The server needs string, number, math, and counter routes to start properly, but tests only check echo operations.

  Steps:
  1. Create a new route file - name it server/routes/echo.js
  2. Create other route files - name them server/routes/string.js, server/routes/number.js, server/routes/math.js, and server/routes/counter.js (needed for server to start, but not tested)
  3. Go straight to server/index.js - no need to search folders
  4. Add all the routes to the server
  5. Start at each spot, testing various ways in

  Expected functionality:
  The text endpoint returns the same text that was sent
  The number endpoint returns the same number that was sent
  The match endpoint checks if two values are equal
  Check if the value field exists for the text endpoint only

  Technical requirements:
  - Use Express.js for routing
  Return correct HTTP status codes for tested situations
  {"response": "Give back JSON replies using the same setup every time"}

  Success criteria:
  All three speak plainly - though their heads tick in separate ways: one moves slow and steady, the next leaps around ideas, whereas the last double-checks along the way - but still, each hits the mark, never missing
  Sort out mistakes without stress if facts aren't right
  Fits right into your day - no stress, everything flows naturally after that

  Critical tested requirements:
  Sending a POST to /api/echo/text with {"value": "hello"} returns {"echo": "hello"}
  - Sending a POST to /api/echo/text breaks with 400 if no value is there
  Hitting /api/echo/number via POST with {"value": 42} gives back {"echo": 42}
  Sending a POST request to /api/echo/match with {"a": "test", "b": "test"} returns {"match": true}
  - POST /api/echo/match with {"a": "test", "b": "no"} returns {"match": false}
  Note: Error handling only tested for text endpoint missing field
