C Data Structures & Algorithms Learning Platform

Project Overview:
This is a comprehensive MERN stack web application designed to teach and demonstrate C programming data structures and algorithms through an interactive learning platform. The platform provides hands-on coding experience with real-time compilation, execution, and testing of C code.

Architecture:
- Frontend: React.js with modern UI (TailwindCSS, Monaco Editor)
- Backend: Node.js with Express.js
- Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Language: C (for data structures and algorithms)
- Testing: Jest (JavaScript) and pytest (Python)

Key Features:
1. Interactive C Code Editor with Monaco Editor
2. Real-time C code compilation and execution
3. Comprehensive data structures library (arrays, linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.)
4. Algorithm implementation and testing platform
5. User authentication and progress tracking
6. Task-based learning system with automated testing
7. Code validation and formatting tools
8. Performance analysis and complexity visualization

Core Components:
- Data Structures Module: Complete implementations of common data structures in C
- Algorithms Module: Sorting, searching, graph algorithms, dynamic programming
- Compiler Service: Real-time C code compilation and execution
- User Management: Authentication, progress tracking, leaderboards
- Task System: Structured learning tasks with automated testing

API Endpoints:
- /api/health - Health check endpoint
- /api/auth/* - Authentication and user management
- /api/datastructures/* - Data structure CRUD operations
- /api/algorithms/* - Algorithm CRUD operations and submission
- /api/compiler/* - Code compilation, validation, and formatting
- /api/users/* - User profile and progress management

Testing Framework:
- Base tests: Jest tests for core API functionality
- Task tests: pytest-based tests for specific learning tasks
- Automated diff application for null agent compatibility
- Health check integration for containerized testing

Docker Integration:
- Multi-stage Docker build with Node.js and Python support
- Automated test execution via run_tests.sh script
- Git-based diff application for task implementation
- Health check endpoints for container orchestration

Educational Focus:
The platform is designed to help students learn C programming through practical implementation of data structures and algorithms. Each task includes:
- Detailed problem descriptions
- Example implementations
- Automated test suites
- Performance analysis
- Step-by-step learning progression

Compatibility:
- Oracle Agent: Full support with direct implementation
- Null Agent: Diff-based task application
- Containerized testing with Docker Compose
- Automated grading workflow integration
